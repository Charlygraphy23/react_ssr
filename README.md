### React SSR

Letâ€™s create a React app with client-side rendering (SSR) from scratch. 

Prerequisites - 

- Knowledge of React - because we are building a React app
- Knowledge of Javascript - because react is a javascript library
- Knowledge of Webpack - because the app needs to be served on the client side, and all the js file needs to be bundled so that they can be run in all browser
- Knowledge of NodeJs/ExpressJs - to server the app to the server

Letâ€™s start ðŸ¤œ

```
cd client
npm i
cd ..
cd server
npm i 
```

First let's install all the packages for each folder.

So now you good to go. Let see how to run SSR app

- do build the client app by `npm run build` from the client folder
- then do build the server by `npm run build` from the server folder
- then start the server by using  `npm start`  it will start the backend server on port `3000`

Hurrey!! ðŸŽ‰
